\section{Topic Background}


\section{Motivation}
The motivation behind this project was the thought that, if there was a platform where we can find the workers needed for our day to day living. If we needed an electrician we don't have to go looking for an electrician but the only thing that we have to do is just make a post, where many professionals (electrician) can find you and have your work done with the best price.
